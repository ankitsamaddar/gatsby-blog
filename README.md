  Gatsby Blog Site
</h1>

This is a blog site created using JAMStack in Gatsby. The blogs are written in markdown and is processed by Gatsby Plugins.
It fetches the contents using GraphQL.

_Live Version_: [brawny-wing.surge.sh](https://brawny-wing.surge.sh/)

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI ([install instructions](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-0/#gatsby-cli)) to create a new site, specifying the starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using a starter
    gatsby new blog-site https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
    ```

2.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd blog-site/
    gatsby develop
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/getting-started/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries).

    Open the `blog-site` directory in your code editor (VS Code) of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ðŸš€ Deployment

Deploy the project from commandline with [Surge](https://surge.sh/):
